This project is an ML algorithm that detects heart disease based off the heart_disease_data.csv.
For the project to work make sure that when you open the code on your computer to upload the CSV file on Colab or Jupyter Notebooks.
This is a replicate project that I learned how to code from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmqCYC-MBQo.
Shout out to Siddhardhan for the amazing tutorial.
